# CnTPieMenu

This repository contains an implementation of pie menu which is inteded to replace context menus, written back in 2010-2013 when I was evaluating efficiency of mouse-oriented operations in graduate school.

There are 2 demo apps in which you can open a pie menu with seconday button click. After opening a pie menu, you can just move mouse pointer to choose an item without clicking on it. So it's just click-and-throw, not click-move-stop-and-click.

Please note that these codes are written solely for experimental purpose and not production-ready. You'll need a lot of work to fit them into a real-world applications.
